# CRUD1
SQL Server Database some functionality:

C (create) --> Technically insert command into database
R (read) --> Technically viewing with Gridview data object
U (update) --> Update :3
D (delete) --> Delete ^-^

This example uses Gridview to access and display a SQL Server Database Table and allow for the basic CRUD functionality.

Some validation is implemented with validation controls attached to the standard controls as well.
